DAX Formulas Used in Measures
1. Total Casualties For Current Year and Year on Year Growth

* Current Year To Date Casualties -- CY Casualties Measure
CY Casualties = TOTALYTD(SUM(Data[Number_of_Casualties]), 'Calendar'[Date])

* Previous Year Casualties -- PY Casualties Measure
PY Casualties = CALCULATE(SUM(Data[Number_of_Casualties]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar'[Date]))

* Year on Year Growth of Casualties - YoY Casualties Measure
YoY Casualties = ([CY Casualties] - [PY Casualties])/[PY Casualties]

2. Total Accidents for Current Year and Year on Year Growth

* Current Year Accidents Count -- CY Accidents Count Measure
CY Accidents Count = TOTALYTD(COUNT(Data[Accident_Index]), 'Calendar'[Date])

*Previous Year Accidents Count -- PY Accidents Count Measure
PY Accidents Count = CALCULATE(COUNT(Data[Accident_Index]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar'[Date]))

* Year on Year Growth of Accidents - YoY Accidents Measure
YoY Accidents = ([CY Accidents Count]-[PY Accidents Count])/[PY Accidents Count]
