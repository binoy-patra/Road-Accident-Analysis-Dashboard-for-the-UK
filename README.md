# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard for the UK (2021 & 2022)

## Introduction

Road safety is a crucial concern impacting communities worldwide. The Road Accident Analytics Dashboard project aims to analyze and visualize road accident data from the UK for the years 2021 and 2022. This Excel-based dashboard provides stakeholders with essential insights to make data-driven decisions, enhancing road safety and minimizing accidents. By leveraging this powerful tool, stakeholders can identify trends, pinpoint high-risk areas, and implement effective safety measures.

## Problem Statement

The client seeks to create a comprehensive road accident dashboard to gain insights into various aspects of road safety for the years 2021 and 2022. The primary objectives are to understand the total number of casualties and accidents, evaluate accident severity, identify trends in accident data, and determine areas that require targeted interventions.

## Required Analysis

The dashboard aims to provide insights into the following key performance indicators (KPIs):

### Primary KPIs
- Total Casualties and Total Accidents for the Current Year and Year-over-Year (YoY) growth.
- Total Casualties by Accident Severity for the Current Year and YoY growth.

### Secondary KPIs
- Total Casualties concerning Vehicle Type for the Current Year.
- Monthly trend comparing casualties for the Current Year and the Previous Year.
- Casualties by Road Type for the Current Year.
- Current Year Casualties by Area/Location and by Day/Night.
- Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location.

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning and Transformation

The data cleaning and transformation phase involved the following steps:
- Checking for NULL values, blanks, and errors.
- Removing duplicates and irrelevant columns.
- Ensuring data consistency and cleanliness regarding data type, format, and values.
- Creating new attributes 'Year' and 'Month' for logical and easy dataset interpretation.

### Dashboard Creation Using Power BI

The cleaned and transformed data was then imported into Power BI to create a dynamic and interactive dashboard. The process included:
- Designing visualizations to represent various KPIs.
- Creating filters and slicers for user interactivity.
- Implementing charts and graphs to display trends and patterns.
- Ensuring the dashboard is user-friendly and provides actionable insights.

## Key Findings

### Total Casualties Analysis
- A staggering 417,883 casualties occurred over the two-year period.

### Peak Months
- Casualties were slightly higher in 2021 than in 2022.
- Maximum casualties occurred in October and November, while January and February had the least.

### Casualties by Vehicle Type
- Car accidents accounted for 79.8% of total casualties.
- Casualties were minimal in accidents involving other vehicle types.

### Casualties by Accident Severity
- Slight severity casualties formed 84.1%, whereas fatal severity casualties were only 1.7%.

### Road Type Analysis
- Maximum casualties occurred on single carriageway roads (310.1K).
- Minimum casualties occurred on slip roads (5.1K).

### Casualties Distribution by Road Surface
- 67% of total casualties occurred on dry road surfaces.

### Casualties Relation by Area/Location
- Urban areas accounted for 61% of total casualties.

### Casualties Distribution by Light Condition
- 73% of casualties occurred in daylight conditions.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Target High-Risk Periods**:
   - Enhance road safety measures during critical periods like October and November, as identified by the monthly casualty trends.

2. **Focus on Car Drivers**:
   - Implement awareness campaigns, strict monitoring, and periodic check-ups on safe driving for car drivers, who form the bulk of casualties.

3. **Improve Single Carriageway Roads**:
   - Upgrade single carriageway roads to double lanes where possible and implement extra safety measures.

4. **Enhance Road Surface Maintenance**:
   - Improve road maintenance and surface conditions based on casualty distribution on different road surfaces.

5. **Urban Area Interventions**:
   - Focus interventions on urban areas to enhance road safety, particularly during daylight conditions.
